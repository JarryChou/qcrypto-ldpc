<p>This is a collection of stream definitions for the data packets exchanged for the error correction procedure. Unlike the streams for the raw key generation, most of these messages do not justify the existence of an independent file, and do not have to be buffered for an unpredictable time. Thus, the communication between the two error correction programs can be connected via a stream- or packet-oriented communication channel (bidirectional).</p>
<p>For simplified embedding and packet consumption, each packet has an information about its length in the header, allowing a transport layer to determine the end of a stream, given a known header.</p>
<p>For consistency with the raw key files, and for a possible debugging of individual messages, the streams still have a header tag identifying them as error correction packets. Communication is tailored to be socket-oriented, but can be performed via a pipe or FIFO entry in the file tree as well to simplify the current operation of the transport layer. This means that a packet is usually sent via write (2) into a pipe, where it is merged with other packets from the sifting communication.</p>
<p>To optimize losses due to communication, several epochs of raw key are grouped together to a larger key (referred to as block in the following). The optimal window for the size of a block is determined from a higher level (possibly manually entered). The size of a block is variable (no fixed length), but is limited to 2^16 bits such that a bit index stays within the size of 16 bit.</p>
<p>The processing of the data is asymmetric: We distinguish two parties (Alice and Bob) for the different roles in the error correction. Most likely there will be an asymmetry in the communication bandwidth in both directions, therefore the choice of roles should be matched to a currently available network bandwidth.</p>
<p>Because the action of the programs will most of the time depend on the arrival of a particular package, both roles could be implemented in the same program.A distinction of which role has to be assumed will be made by the nature of the packet received. The initiation of a processing of a block can be initiated by an external command to the error correction program.</p>
<p>The specification of packet formats follow the requirements for a cascade error correction scheme:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Preliminary error determination</li>
</ol>
<p>In this step, the initial error rate in the raw key is determined. This step also initiates the error correction procedure, and defines the role distribution for a particular block.</p>
<p>This step is initiated by Alice, who sends a random subset of the raw key to Bob. Depending on the security requirement, the subset is either determined by a Pseudorandom sequence generator with a randomly chosen seed, or an explicit good random number subset. The length of the chosen subset is determined by an assumption about the expected error rate from previous packets.</p>
<p>For both possibilities, packets are defined:</p>
<p>1.1 packet for PRNG based subset for bit subset transmission packet name: ERRDET_0 The packet format is a header of the following structure, followed by a data field with a length of multiple of 4 bytes.</p>
<p>packet header:</p>
<p>struct <a class="el" href="struct_e_r_r_c___e_r_r_d_e_t__0.html" title="packet for PRNG based subset for bit subset transmission in err estim">ERRC_ERRDET_0</a> { unsigned int tag; unsigned int bytelength; unsigned int subtype; unsigned int epoch; unsigned int number_of_epochs; unsigned int seed; unsigned int numberofbits; unsigned int errormode; }</p>
<p>element definition: tag: 6 for an error correction packet bytelength: contains the length of the packet (including complete header) in bytes subtype: 0 for PRNG based subset epoch: defines epoch of first packet number_of_epochs defines implicitly the length of the block seed: seed for a PRNG used to determine the bit selection numberofbits: number of bits to follow errormode: describes if an initial error estimation should be done or not. if this value is 0, errorest is done, otherwise the value contains the assumed error for block optimization in multiples of 2^-16.</p>
<p>data format: the data section contains the selected bits in a packed format; all bits are packed into 32 bit wide unsigned ints, with the first bit forming the MSB of the first integer. Tailing bits are padded with 0.</p>
<p>1.2 packet for explicitely indexed bit fields, based on a better local random number generator on Alice's side. The index and result is stored in a compressed format, where the differences of the indices are encoded with a given bit length, followed by the bit itself. This format is similar to the packing format of stream-4 files. The only compression parameter in the header is the bit length for an unescaped index difference between two indices. The packet consists again of a header and a variable length data section. The length of an exception header is kept at 32 bit for processing simplicity, although the maximum difference can only be 16 bit. (should that be changed?)</p>
<p>packet name: ERRDET_1</p>
<p>packet header:</p>
<p>struct <a class="el" href="struct_e_r_r_c___e_r_r_d_e_t__1.html" title="packet for explicitely indexed bit fields with a good RNG for err est">ERRC_ERRDET_1</a> { unsigned int tag; unsigned int bytelength; unsigned int subtype; unsigned int epoch; unsigned int number_of_epochs; unsigned int bitlength; unsigned int numberofbits; }</p>
<p>element definition: tag: 6 for an error correction packet bytelength: contains the length of the packet (including complete header) in bytes subtype: 1 for good random number based subset epoch: defines epoch of first packet number_of_epochs defines implicitly the length of the block bitlength: defines the compression bit width for the index difference. should be smaller than 16 bit, otherwise the compression is pointless. numberofbits: number of bits to follow</p>
<p>data format: the data section contains the selected bits in a packed format; see definition of stream-4 packed index files and assume a bitlength of 1 for the desired information.</p>
<p>1.3 acknowledgment packet for requesting more sample bis In case the confidence level in the error correction is not sufficient, Bob requests additional bits from Alice with this packet, initiating further packets ERRDET_0 or ERRDET_1. It is the obligation of the program on bobs side to ensure that no bit is sent which was sent before. This probably requires some self-consistent choice of the seeded PRNG or an intermediate storage for the true RN chosen bits on alice's side.</p>
<p>packet name: ERRDET_2</p>
<p>The packet consists only of the following structure:</p>
<p>struct <a class="el" href="struct_e_r_r_c___e_r_r_d_e_t__2.html" title="packet for requesting more sample bits">ERRC_ERRDET_2</a> { unsigned int tag; unsigned int bytelength; unsigned int subtype; unsigned int epoch; unsigned int number_of_epochs; unsigned int requestedbits; }</p>
<p>element definition: tag: 6 for an error correction packet bytelength: contains the length of the packet (including complete header) in bytes; This is fixed to 24 subtype: 2 for request of bit number packet epoch: defines epoch of first packet number_of_epochs defines implicitly the length of the block requestedbits: the number of additionally required bits.</p>
<p>1.4 Acknowledgment packet for communicating the error rate. This message returns the number of errors found in the subset. It will also be used to determine if this block has to be aborted altogether due to excessive large errors on both sides without further communication. After receipt of this packet, the next round of error correction is initiated. On both sides, the residual raw key is packed to remove the tested bits from further processing. The number of residual bits has to be remembered on both sides.</p>
<p>packet name: ERRDET_3</p>
<p>The packet consists only of the following structure:</p>
<p>struct <a class="el" href="struct_e_r_r_c___e_r_r_d_e_t__3.html" title="Acknowledgment packet for communicating the error rate.">ERRC_ERRDET_3</a> { unsigned int tag; unsigned int bytelength; unsigned int subtype; unsigned int epoch; unsigned int number_of_epochs; unsigned int tested_bits; unsigned int number_of_errors; }</p>
<p>element definition: tag: 6 for an error correction packet bytelength: contains the length of the packet (including complete header) in bytes; This is fixed to 28 subtype: 3 for request of bit number packet epoch: defines epoch of first packet number_of_epochs defines implicitly the length of the block tested_bits: the number of bits tested number_of_errors: how many mismatches were found.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First round of parity bit generation</li>
</ol>
<p>In this section, two versions of the bitstream are considered: The unpermutated version (0), and a second permutated copy (1). Both strings are partitioned in subblocks with a length of k0 and k1 bits, respectively, and a comparison of their parities is performed.</p>
<p>The initial parity information is transmitted to the other side in one message, and a subsequent exchange of bisections of subblocks are performed in followup messages until all initial parity mismatches are discovered.</p>
<p>2.1 Packet for the first parity transmission</p>
<p>This packet needs to contain reference informtion, a seed for the choice of the permutation (or alternatively, a permutation list), optionally the blocksize for the partitioning, and the parity information. it goes from the alice identity to the bob identity.</p>
<p>The packet consists again of a header and a variable length data section. The data section is a sequence of longints, containing the parity information in a packed format. It starts with a number of words capable to containing the bits in pass 0, and continues with a section containing the parity bits in pass</p><ol type="1">
<li><p class="startli">The bits of pass 1 start at a new longint boundary. The length of the whole message should be compilable from the number of bits, k0 and k1. The information in k0, k1, and totalbits is redundant, they are at the moment only kept for possible extension.</p>
<p class="startli">packet name: ERRDET_4 <br  />
</p>
<p class="startli">The packet consists of the following header structure and a data stream:</p>
<p class="startli">struct <a class="el" href="struct_e_r_r_c___e_r_r_d_e_t__4.html" title="first parity check bit info">ERRC_ERRDET_4</a> { unsigned int tag; unsigned int bytelength; unsigned int subtype; unsigned int epoch; unsigned int number_of_epochs; unsigned int k0; unsigned int k1; unsigned int totalbits; unsigned int seed; } <br  />
</p>
<p class="startli">element definition: tag: 6 for an error correction packet bytelength: contains the length of the packet (including complete header) in bytes; subtype: 4 for request of bit number packet epoch: defines epoch of first packet number_of_epochs defines implicitly the length of the block k0, k1: size of partitions totalbits: the number of bits considered for error estimation seed: seed for the PRNG to choose the permutation</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Data format are unsigned ints (32bit), containing the parity results (0 even, 1 odd) for the blocks in both runs. first bit is msb in the first longint, and each parity block starts at a new longint boundary.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Binary search</li>
</ol>
<p>In this section, the errors in subblocks with nonmatching parity should be isolated and the faulty bits finally corrected. For this, a packet is needed from the bob side to alice to transmit the parity of a sub-block to the other side, and to answer with a refined subblock/answer message. The discussion will initially convey the information on the block address, and in subsequent communication only contain the upper/lower section information as the rest is implicit. This means that the number of blocks is not changed for all biconf passes; blocks where a redundant bisection has been reached are used to transmit the same bit again (no information is lost this way).</p>
<p>3.1 Binary search message group</p>
<p>packet name: ERRDET_5 <br  />
</p>
<p>The packet consists of the following header structure and a data stream:</p>
<p>struct <a class="el" href="struct_e_r_r_c___e_r_r_d_e_t__5.html" title="Binary search message packet.">ERRC_ERRDET_5</a> { unsigned int tag; unsigned int bytelength; unsigned int subtype; unsigned int epoch; unsigned int number_of_epochs; unsigned int number_entries; unsigned int index_present; unsigned int runlevel; }</p>
<p>element definition:</p>
<p>tag: 6 for an error correction packet bytelength: contains the length of the packet (including complete header) in bytes; subtype: 5 for request of bit number packet epoch: defines epoch of first packet number_of_epochs defines implicitly the length of the block number_entries defines the number of blocks with parity mismatch index_present: decides if and in which format the index data is contained in the packet runlevel: a combined quantity which identifies the pass and bisectioning depth of each block. The pass (0/1) is encoded in the most significant bit, the bisectioning depth in the least significant bits. For the fist run, this quantity contains 0, referring to a splitting in two parts of the original section. There was a need to add another flag for indicating the source buffer in case it is a BICONF_CHECK round.</p>
<p>The data section contains (a) a parity array, bit-packed similarly to the original parity communication packet. It is an array of unsigned ints, capable to contain all the number_entries bits.</p>
<p>If the index_present word is 0, an array containing one bit per subblock if the upper or lower in the same encoding as the parity bit follows, which contains information if the error from the previous cycle is contained in the first (0) or second (1) half of the interval.</p>
<p>If the newly tested interval length is 0, the parity bit will be zero.</p>
<p>If the index_present word is &gt;0, one of the following encoding schemes for the indices are used:</p>
<p>index_present = 1: plain uint encoding The data following the parity data is an array of unsigned ints containing the block addresses directly.</p>
<p>NEW VERSION: No, keep old version index_present = 2: a single longint fields with an explicit start and end address for the subblock of the BICONF_binsearch cycle.</p>
<p>OLD VERSION: index_present = 2: plain shortint encoding same as index 1, but with short integers as numbers. Array is padded with 0 at the end to have a length of multiple of 4 bytes.</p>
<p>index_present = 3: a packed bitfield for each original block is sent, containing information if there is a mismatch (1) or match (0).The data is padded with 0 at the end to form a inter multiple of 32words.</p>
<p>OLD VERSION; OBSOLETE? no, keep using it, but only with one entry. index_present = 4: a two-entry longint fields with two explicit start addresses for the two start addresses of the biconf blocks is transmitted. (first one is zero, second one is biconflen )</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Binary search/confirmation <br  />
 To eliminate the final errors, and obtain a low residual bit error rate, a final error checking is performed on single stretches of long random sections of a permuted key. The initial parity evaluation is initated by bob after a successful binary search algorithm, who names a seed for the permutation and a bit length. Alice replies with the initial parity of the. For this purpose, two specific messages are used, while a possible binary search uses the existing message blocks.</li>
</ol>
<p>4.1 BICONF request message</p>
<p>With this message, bob initiates the alice side to emit a parity pattern with a given length.</p>
